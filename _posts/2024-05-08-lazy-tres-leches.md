## Ingredients

- 1 box yellow cake mix
  - Eggs
  - Oil
- Tres leches
  - 1 (14-ounce) can can of sweetened condensed milk
  - 1 (12-ounce) can of evaporated milk
  - 1/2 cup whole milk
- Topping
  - 1 cup heavy cream
  - 2 tablespoons powdered sugar, sifted
  - Pinch of kosher salt
  - Strawberries
  
## Directions

1. Follow the instructions on the box to bake the yellow cake in a 9" x 13" pan.
2. While the cake is baking, combine condensed milk, evaporated milk, and whole milk in a bowl and mix.
3. When the cake is cool, using a fork, poke holes in the top of the cake. Pour the milk mixture over the cake (it may seem like a lot but it will absorb!). Transfer to the fridge to 2 to 3 hours, ideally overnight.
4. In a separate bowl before serving, using an electric mixer, mix the heavy cream, sifted powdered sugar and salt until soft peaks form. Top the cake with the fluffy whipped cream. Finally, top with strawberries.
