<ul>
  <li>2 cups heavy or light cream (or half-and-half)</li>
  <li>1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise, or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
  <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>

<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Heat oven to 325 degrees. In a saucepan, combine cream, vanilla bean and salt; cook over low heat just until hot. Let sit for a few minutes, then discard vanilla bean. (If using vanilla extract, add it now.)</li>
  <li>In a bowl, beat yolks and sugar together until light. Stir about a quarter of the vanilla cream into this mixture, then pour sugar-egg mixture into cream and stir. Pour into four 6-ounce ramekins and place ramekins in a baking dish; fill dish with boiling water halfway up the sides of the ramekins.</li>
  <li>Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until centers are barely set. Cool completely. Refrigerate for several hours and up to a couple of days. Image of cream out of the oven barely set for making Vanilla Crème Brûlée</li>
