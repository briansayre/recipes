<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>3 cans buttermilk biscuits (the non-flaky ones)</li>
  <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
  <li>2 to 3 tsp. cinnamon</li>
  <li>1 cup butter</li>
  <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 350F.</li>
  <li>Open up all 3 cans of biscuits and cut each biscuit into quarters.</li>
  <li>Combine the white sugar with 2 to 3 teaspoons of cinnamon. (3 teaspoons of cinnamon gives it a fairly strong cinnamon flavor. If you’re not so hot on cinnamon, cut it back to 2 teaspoons.) Dump these into a 1 gallon zip-top bag and shake to combine.</li>
  <li>Drop all of the biscuit quarters into the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Once all the biscuit quarters are in the bag, seal it and give it a vigorous shake. This will get all those pieces unstuck from one another and nicely coated with cinnamon-sugar. Spread these nuggets out evenly in the Bundt pan.</li>
  <li>At this point, you’re going to want to melt the butter together with 1/2 cup of brown sugar in a saucepan over medium-high heat. This can be light or dark brown sugar. Cook butter-sugar mixture, stirring for a few minutes until the two become one. Once the brown sugar butter has become one color, you can pour it over the biscuits.</li>
  <li>Bake for about 35 to 40 minutes until the crust is a deep dark brown on top. When it’s finished cooking, remove it from the oven. If you have the willpower, allow it to cool</li>
</ol>
